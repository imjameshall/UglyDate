UglyDate
===================
A JavaScript date range selector for everyone.

The Ugly Philosophy
------
### Single Responsibility Principle
UglyDate handles date ranges well and that's all. As a purpose specific component it will solve this one problem perfectly, without the bloat of extra code for unneeded features.

### UX Driven
UglyDate is inspired by [Google Flights](http://google.com/travel), arguably the most intuitive date range selector out there.

### Responsive
UglyDate is mobile friendly out of the box.

### Progressively Enhanced
Designed to work with two date `input`s, UglyDate is built with accessibility in mind.

### Radically Open
Besides being open source, included in this repository is a `prototypes` directory that shows how the component was made. Whether you're a student, just getting started or interested in someone else's process, this is for you!

### Ugly Themeâ„¢
This component is deliberately terrible looking. Developers cannot get away with simply installing this component without designer support.
