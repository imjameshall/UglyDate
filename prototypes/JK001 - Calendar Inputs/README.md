# Start and End Dates

Basic input dates. 

One thing I learned from this is that we want the end date `min` to be tomorrow, since you need to book for at least one day.
Subsequently that means we need the start date `max` to be one day less than the end date `max`, since we need to be able to have one extra day there given the above.

Will need to keep that sort of thing in mind as you select things.
